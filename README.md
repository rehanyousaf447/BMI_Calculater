# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## My Goal

how I can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. If I have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, I can create them using Flutter. 


## What I have Created

I am going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.

- How to use Flutter themes.
- How to create multi-page apps using Flutter Routes and Navigator.
- How to extract and refactor Flutter Widgets with a click of the button.
